MacOS Bootstrap
=============

This is a repository used to make the process of setting up a new
install of MacOS as simple as possible.

It will do the following:
- Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if it hasn't been already
- Install a number of applications through `brew` commands
- Configures [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) with good default preferences and custom CSS. Assumes that the user will want to use Tree Style Tabs.

Last tested with MacOS Big Sur 11.4 on the date of this line's blame.
